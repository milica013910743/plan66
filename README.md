The libarchive project develops a portable, efficient C library that can read and write streaming archives in a variety of formats. It also includes implementations of the common tar, cpio, and zcat command-line tools that use the libarchive library.
The freeCodeCamp.org community is possible thanks to thousands of kind volunteers like you. We welcome all contributions to the community and are excited to welcome you aboard.
